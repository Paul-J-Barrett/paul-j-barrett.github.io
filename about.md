I am the IT Director / Chief Architect and Programmer for the Las Vegas Athletic Clubs. I have written several major membership and business applications for my last couple of employers. I have also written some small apps for IOS and Android but wouldn't call myself proficient due to lack of time to spend on IOS, Andriod, BB10, and W8 mobile. However I am highly proficient with ASP, ASP.net, C#, Windows C# Forms, and MSSQL. I have also maintained and written some rather complex things with PHP and mysql. And of course I know a great deal about HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

I have kids but am trying to get out and network more with fellow developers and the folks over at the SynShop. So far everything about the #VegasTech is exciting in the downtown area. (I lived on 17th street for 13 years and used to work for Anderson Dairy for 6 of those years).

In the last 3 years the tech scene in Vegas has drastically changed thanks to Zappos employees and other enthusiastic people.
